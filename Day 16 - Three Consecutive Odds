LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.

Initialization: int cnt = 0; initializes a counter variable to zero.

Loop through the array: for (int v : arr) is a for-each loop that iterates over each element v in the array arr.

Check if the element is odd: if (v % 2 == 1) checks if the current element v is an odd number. If it is, the counter (cnt) is incremented by 1.

Reset counter if even: else block is executed when the current element is even. In such cases, the counter is reset to zero since consecutive odd numbers are broken.

Check for three consecutive odds: if (cnt == 3) checks if the counter has reached a value of 3, indicating that three consecutive odd numbers have been found. If true, the method returns true immediately.

Continue iteration: If the condition in step 5 is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.

Return false if no match found: If the loop completes without finding three consecutive odd numbers, the method returns false.
