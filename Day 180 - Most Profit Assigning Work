LOGIC: Explanation
Example - Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialization: Create a list of job difficulties and their corresponding profits.
Sorting: Sort the list based on job difficulties.
Max Profit Calculation: Create a list to store the maximum profit for each difficulty level.
Update Maximum Profit: Traverse the sorted list to update the maximum profit for each difficulty.
Total Profit Calculation: Initialize total profit to zero.
Binary Search: For each worker, use binary search to find the highest difficulty job they can do.
Add Profit: Add the corresponding profit to the total profit if the worker can perform the job.
Return: Return the total profit accumulated.
