 Level - Medium (1717)
 LOGIC: Explanation 
 Example - Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.

Class Declaration:
The class Solution contains a public method maximumGain that takes a string s and two integers x and y as input.

Variable Initialization:
countA and countB are initialized to 0 to keep track of the counts of 'a' and 'b' characters, respectively.
result is initialized to 0 to store the total gain.
less is set to the minimum of x and y.

Iterating Through the String:
A for loop iterates through each character in the string s.

Character Processing:
For each character ch in the string:
If ch is greater than 'b':
Calculate the gain from the minimum count of 'a' and 'b' multiplied by less.
Reset countA and countB to 0.

If ch is 'a':
If x is less than y and countB is greater than 0:
Decrement countB and add y to the result.
Else, increment countA.

If ch is 'b':
If x is greater than y and countA is greater than 0:
Decrement countA and add x to the result.
Else, increment countB.

Final Calculation:
After the loop, add the gain from the minimum count of 'a' and 'b' multiplied by less to the result.

Return Result:
Return the final result value.
