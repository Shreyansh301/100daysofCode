LOGIC: Explantion 
Example - Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.

The given Java code defines a class Solution with a method largestAltitude. This method takes an array of integers called gain as input and returns an integer representing the largest altitude.
int n = gain.length;: Retrieves the length of the array gain and stores it in the variable n.
int max_so_far = 0;: Initializes a variable max_so_far to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum altitude encountered so far.
int max_final = 0;: Initializes a variable max_final to 0. This variable will store the final result, i.e., the largest altitude.

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++): A loop that iterates over each element in the array gain.

a. max_so_far += gain[i];: Updates max_so_far by adding the current element of gain to it. This represents the cumulative altitude gain as the loop progresses.
b. max_final = Math.max(max_final, max_so_far);: Updates max_final by taking the maximum value between its current value and max_so_far. 
This ensures that max_final always holds the maximum altitude encountered during the iteration.

return max_final;: Returns the final result, which represents the largest altitude encountered during the entire journey.
