Level - Easy (1863)
LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: 6
 The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:
- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [3] has an XOR total of 3.
- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.
0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

Class Definition
Class Solution: Defines the main class Solution.

Main Function
public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums):
This is the main function that calculates the sum of XORs of all subsets of the array nums.
It calls a helper function with initial parameters: the array nums, starting level 0, and initial currentXOR value 0.

Helper Function
public int helper(int[] nums, int level, int currentXOR):
This is a recursive function that calculates the XOR sum of subsets by either including or excluding the current element.

Base Condition:
If level equals the length of nums, it returns the currentXOR value. This signifies reaching the end of the array and forms the base case for recursion.

Include Case:
Calls itself recursively with the next level (level + 1) and includes the current element in the XOR calculation (currentXOR ^ nums[level]).

Exclude Case:
Calls itself recursively with the next level (level + 1) but excludes the current element, keeping currentXOR unchanged.

Return:
Sums the results of the include and exclude cases and returns the total XOR sum of all subsets.
