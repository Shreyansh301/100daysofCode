LOGIC: Explantion 
Example - Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

Class Definition: Defines a public class named Solution.
Method Declaration: Declares a public method minMovesToSeat that takes two integer arrays seats and students.
Sorting Seats: Sorts the seats array in ascending order.
Sorting Students: Sorts the students array in ascending order.
Initialize Moves: Initializes an integer variable moves to 0.
Loop Through Arrays: Iterates over the arrays from index 0 to the length of the arrays.
Calculate Moves: Adds the absolute difference between corresponding elements of seats and students to moves.
Return Result: Returns the total moves.
