}

LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This Java code is an implementation of a function maxProfit that calculates the maximum profit a person can make by buying and selling stocks with a transaction fee. 
The function takes an array of stock prices (prices) and a transaction fee (fee) as parameters.

Check if the input array prices is null or empty. If so, return 0, as there are no transactions to be made.

Initialize variables buy, sell, and profit.
buy represents the minimum cost to buy a stock at the current point.
sell represents the maximum profit after selling a stock at the current point.
profit represents the accumulated profit.

Iterate through the array prices starting from index 1 (since we initialize buy with the first price).
Update buy to be the minimum of the current buy and the difference between the current stock price and the accumulated profit.
Update sell to be the maximum of the accumulated profit and the difference between the current stock price, buy, and the transaction fee.
Update profit with the value of sell.

After the loop, return the final accumulated profit, which represents the maximum profit achievable with the given transaction fee.
