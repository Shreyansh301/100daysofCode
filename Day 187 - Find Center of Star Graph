class Solution {
    public int findCenter(int[][] edges) {
        if (edges[0][0] == edges[1][0] || edges[0][0] == edges[1][1]) {
            return edges[0][0];

Level - Easy (1791)
LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

Class Definition:
The code defines a public class named Solution.

Method Definition:
Inside the Solution class, a public method findCenter is defined. This method takes a 2D array edges as input and returns an integer.

Assumption:
The method assumes the input is an edge list representation of a star graph, where one central node is connected to all other nodes.

Identify the Center Node:
The star graph's center node is the one that appears in both edges given in the input.
The method checks if the first node in the first edge (edges[0][0]) matches either of the nodes in the second edge (edges[1][0] or edges[1][1]).
If edges[0][0] matches edges[1][0] or edges[1][1], then edges[0][0] is the center node, and the method returns this value.
If edges[0][0] does not match either node in the second edge, the center node must be the second node in the first edge (edges[0][1]), and the method returns this value.

Return Statement:
The method returns the identified center node of the star graph.
