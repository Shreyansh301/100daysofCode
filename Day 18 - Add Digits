class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        return 1 + (num - 1)% 9;
    }
} 

LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: num = 38
Output: 2
The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.


The method addDigits takes an integer num as input and returns its digital root.

The digital root of a number is the single-digit value obtained by repeatedly adding the digits of the number until a single-digit number is obtained.

The formula used in the code is based on a mathematical property related to digital roots. The formula is:
digitalRoot(num)=1+(num−1)mod9

The expression (num - 1) % 9 computes the remainder when 
(num−1) is divided by 9. This is a key step in the formula.

Adding 1 to the result ensures that the final result is in the range of 1 to 9 (inclusive)
which is the expected range for digital roots. The result is then returned.
