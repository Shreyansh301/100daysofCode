class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
} 

LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16

Java code defines a class named "Solution" with a method "isPowerOfTwo" that takes an integer 'n' as input and returns a boolean. 
It checks if 'n' is a power of two by verifying if 'n' is greater than zero and has only one bit set to 1 in its binary representation, which is accomplished using the bitwise AND operation with 'n' and 'n - 1'. 
If the condition is true, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
