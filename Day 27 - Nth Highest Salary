LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

This code defines a SQL function named getNthHighestSalary that takes an integer parameter N and returns an integer value. The purpose of the function is to retrieve the Nth highest salary from the "employee" table.
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT: This line declares the creation of a function named getNthHighestSalary that takes an integer parameter N and returns an integer.

BEGIN: Marks the beginning of the function's body.

RETURN: Indicates that the function will return a value. The value to be returned is enclosed in parentheses.

The inner query:

Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK () OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as r
    FROM employee
) result
WHERE r = N

The innermost query selects the salary column from the "employee" table and calculates the dense rank (DENSE_RANK()) of each salary in descending order (ORDER BY salary DESC).
The result is aliased as "result."
The outer query selects distinct salaries where the calculated rank (r) equals the input parameter N.

END: Marks the end of the function's body.
