LOGIC: Explanation 
Example - Input: s = "Hello"
Output: "hello"

This Java code defines a class named Solution with a method toLowerCase, which takes a String s as input and converts all the uppercase letters in the string to lowercase. 
The conversion is done by iterating through each character of the input string and checking if it is an uppercase letter. 
If a character is an uppercase letter (ASCII value between 65 and 90), it is converted to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value.

StringBuilder Initialization: The code initializes a StringBuilder named ans to store the result of the lowercase conversion.

Iteration Through Characters: It iterates through each character of the input string using a for loop.

Uppercase to Lowercase Conversion: Inside the loop, it checks if the character is an uppercase letter (ASCII value between 65 and 90) and converts it to lowercase if necessary.

Result Return: The final result is returned as a new string after converting all applicable characters to lowercase.
