LOGIC: Explanatiion 
Example - Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

The Java code defines a method canPlaceFlowers that iterates through a flowerbed array and attempts to plant flowers at suitable positions based on specified conditions, 
returning true if it successfully plants the required number of flowers, and false otherwise.

Iterating through Flowerbed:
The for loop traverses each position in the flowerbed array.

Conditions for Flower Planting:
It checks if the current position is empty (flowerbed[i] == 0).
Additionally, it checks if the previous position is empty or if the current position is the first in the flowerbed.
Also, it checks if the next position is empty or if the current position is the last in the flowerbed.

Planting a Flower:
If all the conditions are met, it sets the current position to 1 (flowerbed[i] = 1), indicating the placement of a flower.
It decrements the remaining number of flowers to be planted (n--).

Checking for Completion:
After each planting attempt, it checks if the required number of flowers (n) has been planted. If so, it returns true.

Return Statement:
If the loop completes and the required number of flowers has not been planted, the method returns false.
